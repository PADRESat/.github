## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the NASA solar Polarization and Directivity X-Ray Experiment (PADRE) mission software repository.
PADRE is a small satellite mission whose purpose is to study particle acceleration during solar flares.
The solar PolArization and Directivity X-Ray Experiment (PADRE) is a 12U small satellite observatory that will observe the Sun in hard X-ray from low earth orbit. PADRE will investigate particle acceleration processes that occur in large solar flares with two unique and comple-mentary approaches (1) by obsering the polarization of the x-ray emission and (2) by coordinating with Solar Orbiter/STIX to make the first two point measurements of x-rays and to determine their directivity. PADRE hosts two instruments:
* solar HARd x-ray Polarimeter (SHARP)
* Measuring Directivity to Determine Electron Anisotropy (MeDDEA)
