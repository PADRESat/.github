## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the [NASA solar Polarization and Directivity X-Ray Experiment (PADRE) mission](https://padre.ssl.berkeley.edu) software repository.
PADRE is a small satellite mission whose purpose is to study particle acceleration during solar flares.
The solar PolArization and Directivity X-Ray Experiment (PADRE) is a 12U small satellite observatory that will observe the Sun in hard X-ray from low earth orbit. PADRE will investigate particle acceleration processes that occur in large solar flares with two unique and complementary approaches 
1. by observing the polarization of the x-ray emission and 
2. by coordinating with Solar Orbiter/STIX to make the first two point measurements of x-rays and to determine their directivity. 

PADRE hosts two instruments:

* solar HARd x-ray Polarimeter (SHARP) led by the [Space Sciences Lab](https://www.ssl.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley
* Measuring Directivity to Determine Electron Anisotropy (MeDDEA) led by the [Heliophysics Division](https://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/heliophysics/) of the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center
